# Secret

Assumption: 1. N is a possitive number

Created a dummy function named "secretFunc" that accepts a single integer parameter 
and returns an integer which I encapsulated in my isSecretFuncAddittive method under Secret class.

N will be set during the creation of Secret object(constructor) and it can also be modified using its setter function (setN())

I have also provided a simple main method for testing purposes.

I used Java in the implementation of this simple application because aside from java being able to support encapsulation, also, I am more comfortable and confident in making applications using the java technology.
